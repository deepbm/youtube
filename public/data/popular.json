        "description": "NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nAshley Pointer | June 14, 2023\nIt's practically a sin to not have Durrell \"Tank\" Babbs on your spiciest playlist — he's penned some of the steamiest records in R&B. If you've been following our Black Music Month takeover, it's likely you spotted Tank accompanying Babyface, the love maestro himself, on background vocals. In his own concert, the veteran crooner and R&B scholar performed a 14-song medley of passionate love songs and bedroom bops from across his 23 years-long career in music, and turned the Tiny Desk into \"the big, nasty Desk.\"\n\nThis doesn't happen without warning: \"Some of these songs make you wanna make up. Some of these songs make you wanna breakup and some of these songs make you want to participate in various sexual activities,\" Tank declared before traversing his catalog. Backed by the phenomenal Florida-based MVP Band, along with a trio of famed background vocalists — singer-songwriter-actor Luke James, singer Brooke Valentine and songwriter/producer Lonny Bereal — we got a taste of the songs that not only established Tank as a pillar in R&B, but hits he wrote and produced for other notable artists such as Jamie Foxx, Omarion, Marques Houston and LeToya Luckett.\n\nFull of buttery smooth runs and yearning melodies (along with the occasional, witty HR joke), Tank's Tiny Desk concert is a stellar display of how powerful the allure of R&B can be, and perhaps a masterclass for any youngin' learning how to woo.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Slowly\"\n\"Coldest\"\n\"Do What It Do\"\n\"O\"\n\"Naked\"\n\"Regret\"\n\"When We\"\n\"Dirty\"\n\"Can't Let It Show\"\n\"Slow\"\n\"See Through Love\"\n\"Maybe I Deserve\"\n\"I Deserve\"\n\"Please Don't Go\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nTank: vocals\nLonny Bereal: vocals\nBrooke Valentine: vocals\nLuke James: vocals\nLa'Chaz Holloway: guitar\nAlex Hill: keys\nJevon Hill: keys, vocals\nArthur Jones: bass\nJimmy Hill: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Neil Tevault \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nEditor: Maia Stern\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Sofia Seidel, Kara Frame\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Elizabeth Gillis\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Josh Rogosin, Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #tank",

        "description": "An out-of-this-world teaser trailer for Disney and Pixar’s 28th feature film, “Elio,” are now available. Additions to the voice cast include: Jameela Jamil and Brad Garrett join previously announced America Ferrera and Yonas Kibreab in the intergalactic misadventure that is scheduled to take off next spring—March 1, 2024.\n \nFor centuries, people have called out to the universe looking for answers—in Disney and Pixar’s all-new movie “Elio,” the universe calls back! The original feature film introduces Elio, an underdog with an active imagination who finds himself inadvertently beamed up to the Communiverse, an interplanetary organization with representatives from galaxies far and wide. Mistakenly identified as Earth’s ambassador to the rest of the universe, and completely unprepared for that kind of pressure, Elio must form new bonds with eccentric alien lifeforms, survive a series of formidable trials and somehow discover who he is truly meant to be. \n \nDirected by Adrian Molina (screenwriter and co-director of “Coco”) and produced by Mary Alice Drumm (associate producer of “Coco”), the film features the voices of America Ferrera as Elio’s mom, Olga; Jameela Jamil as Ambassador Questa; Brad Garrett as Ambassador Grigon; and Yonas Kibreab as the title character. “Elio” releases in theaters March 1, 2024.\n\nFacebook:  https://Facebook.com/Pixar\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/pixar\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pixar",

Waves of people gain access to change their Discord username. However, many people realize that a ton of usernames are taken... What gives?\n\nWell Discord has put in a fancy little reservation system which is so super clear and obvious and totally not making me want to smash my head against the wall. But it either completely screws you over, or it keeps your username safe and sound from people's grimy mittens.\n\n\nLINKS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiscord Previews Server\nhttps://discord.gg/discord-603970300668805120\n\n\nSOCIALS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiscord Server\nhttps://discord.gg/B46HXK5fZm\n\nTwitter\nhttps://twitter.com/notexttospeech\n\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n00:00 - Username Rollout\n01:45 - Reserved Username System\n03:55 - The Username Filter of all Time\n04:14 - Harassment\n05:35 - Rare Username Market\n07:50 - 1 Letter Usernames\n08:39 - Discord Staff Corrupt?1?1?!!?12!\n10:44 - I drink gasoline"

        "description": "Thanks to Muddy Bites for making this project possible! Get yourself some delicious Muddy Bites at Walmart: https://go.muddybites.com/walmart or learn more about Muddy Bites at https://muddybites.com\nI broke the WORLD RECORD for the World’s Largest Ice Cream Cone!\nSUBSCRIBE for a chance at $1,000! ➔ https://www.youtube.com/c/Mbeem10?sub_confirmation=1\n\n📱 FOLLOW MY SOCIALS 📱\n➽ Instagram - @MatthewBeem\n➽ Twitter - @MatthewBeem\n➽ TikTok - @MatthewBeem\n\nI love ice cream and have a history of making some of the largest builds on YouTube so I decided to kick off summer in style by breaking the world record for the world’s largest ice cream cone! I have never built anything like this before and the fact that I live in hot Colorado, instead of cold Norway like the previous record holders, made this extremely difficult. We even had to build a hidden cooling chamber in the cone to prevent the ice cream from melting too quickly and had to create our own chocolate in order to get all of the waffles to stick. This video had lots of ups and downs, but we figured it all out, it turned out incredible and we actually broke the world record! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I love ice cream !\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot WORLDS BIGGEST ICE CREAM SUNDAE CHALLENGE, But Most ice cream scoops balanced on a cone, But I Built The World's Largest Lego Tower, But I Made The World's Largest Pizza (132 Feet), But Worlds Largest Working Computer, But Massive Ice Cream Sundae Challenge (11,000 Calories), But Is This the World's Largest Ice Cream Bar, But TKOR Attempts The Biggest Ice Cream In The World, But I Built Logan Paul the World's Largest Gameboy, But I Built The World's Largest Minecraft Statue, But Tallest Ice Cream Cone, But I Built World’s Largest Minecraft Sword, or any other video like Airrack, Furious Pete, Matthew Beem, MrBeast, Guinness World Records, TKOR, or Matt Stonie would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) breaks the WORLD RECORD for the largest ice cream cone ever built!",

Get yourself some delicious Muddy Bites at Walmart: https://go.muddybites.com/walmart or learn more about Muddy Bites at https://muddybites.com\nI broke the WORLD RECORD for the World’s Largest Ice Cream Cone!\nSUBSCRIBE for a chance at $1,000! ➔ https://www.youtube.com/c/Mbeem10?sub_confirmation=1\n\n📱 FOLLOW MY SOCIALS 📱\n➽ Instagram - @MatthewBeem\n➽ Twitter - @MatthewBeem\n➽ TikTok - @MatthewBeem\n\nI love ice cream and have a history of making some of the largest builds on YouTube so I decided to kick off summer in style by breaking the world record for the world’s largest ice cream cone! I have never built anything like this before and the fact that I live in hot Colorado, instead of cold Norway like the previous record holders, made this extremely difficult. We even had to build a hidden cooling chamber in the cone to prevent the ice cream from melting too quickly and had to create our own chocolate in order to get all of the waffles to stick. This video had lots of ups and downs, but we figured it all out, it turned out incredible and we actually broke the world record! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I love ice cream !\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot WORLDS BIGGEST ICE CREAM SUNDAE CHALLENGE, But Most ice cream scoops balanced on a cone, But I Built The World's Largest Lego Tower, But I Made The World's Largest Pizza (132 Feet), But Worlds Largest Working Computer, But Massive Ice Cream Sundae Challenge (11,000 Calories), But Is This the World's Largest Ice Cream Bar, But TKOR Attempts The Biggest Ice Cream In The World, But I Built Logan Paul the World's Largest Gameboy, But I Built The World's Largest Minecraft Statue, But Tallest Ice Cream Cone, But I Built World’s Largest Minecraft Sword, or any other video like Airrack, Furious Pete, Matthew Beem, MrBeast, Guinness World Records, TKOR, or Matt Stonie would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) breaks the WORLD RECORD for the largest ice cream cone ever built!"
